Apsara üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è is a React UI framework written in TypeScript on top of [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) to power the projects for Open Data Platform. Open Data Platform has a large number of enterprise-level products. With complex scenarios, designers and developers often need to respond fast due to frequent changes in product demands and concurrent R & D workflow. Many similar contents exist in the process. Through abstraction, we could obtain some stable and highly reusable components and pages on top of Ant Design.
