## Usages

Button component is used for primary actions, such as submitting forms, confirming decisions, or initiating important processes.

## Installation

Install the component from your command line.

<LiveProvider>
  <LiveEditor code={`npm install @raystack/apsara`} border />
</LiveProvider>

Import all parts and piece them together.

<LiveProvider>
    <LiveEditor code={`
import { Button } from '@raystack/apsara/v1'

<Button variant="primary">Click here!</Button>`} border />
</LiveProvider>

## Variant

Variants allow you to customize the button's style, making it visually distinctive and suitable for different purposes. Default is `Primary`.

<Playground
  scope={{ Button }}
  tabs={[
    {
      name: "Primary",
      code: `<Button variant="primary">Primary button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Secondary",
      code: `<Button variant="secondary">Secondary button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Outline",
      code: `<Button variant="outline">Outline button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Ghost",
      code: `<Button variant="ghost">Ghost button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Danger",
      code: `<Button variant="danger">Danger button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Text",
      code: `<Button variant="text">Text button</Button>`,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Scale

The Button component offers two size options to accommodate various design requirements. By selecting the `normal` size, you can create buttons that are visually larger, making it more prominent and noticeable within the user interface. Default size is `normal`.

<Playground
  scope={{ Button }}
  tabs={[
    {
      name: "Small",
      code: `<Button variant="primary" size="small">primary button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Normal",
      code: `<Button variant="primary" size="normal">primary button</Button>`,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Disabled

The Button component provides a "disabled" state, which prevents the button from responding to any user actions. When a button is disabled, it becomes unclickable and does not trigger any associated actions or events.

This feature is useful when you want to indicate that a button is temporarily inactive or unavailable for interaction. Default is `false`.

<Playground
  scope={{ Button }}
  tabs={[
    {
      name: "Primary",
      code: `<Button disabled variant="primary">Primary button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Secondary",
      code: `<Button disabled variant="secondary">Secondary button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Outline",
      code: `<Button disabled variant="outline">Outline button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Ghost",
      code: `<Button disabled variant="ghost">Ghost button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Danger",
      code: `<Button disabled variant="danger">Danger button</Button>`,
    },
    {
      name: "Text",
      code: `<Button disabled variant="text">Text button</Button>`,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Loading

The Button component offers inbuilt loading states. Loading state is used to signify an ongoing process after the user has clicked on the button. Loading is an optional prop.

Note: A loading as `true` only disables the button click and displays a spinner within the button. `loading` does not changes the button appearance as disabled. For changing the appearance to disabled state, a `disabled` prop as `true` has to passed.

<Playground
  scope={{ Button }}
  code={`
<div style={{display:'flex', gap: '8px'}}>
    <Button variant="primary" loading>Click here</Button>
    <Button variant="primary" loading loaderText="Custom Loading...">Click here</Button>
    <Button variant="primary" loading loaderText="Loading..." disabled>Click here</Button>
</div>
`}
/>

## With leading and trailing icons

The button component accepts optional leading and/or trailing icons. A `ReactNode` can be passed as a prop.

<Playground
  scope={{ Button }}
  code={`
<div style={{display:'flex', gap: '8px'}}>
    <Button variant="primary" leadingIcon={<>I</>}>With leading icon</Button>
    <Button variant="primary" trailingIcon={<>O</>}>With trailing icon</Button>
    <Button variant="primary" leadingIcon={<>I</>} trailingIcon={<>O</>}>With both icons</Button>
</div>
`}
/>
