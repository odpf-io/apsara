# Accordion

<Description>
A vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an associated section of content.
</Description>

## Installation

1. Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install @odpf/apsara
import { Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, AccordionContent } from '@odpf/apsara';
```

<Accordion type="single">
  <AccordionItem value="accordion-one">
    <AccordionTrigger>
      Accordion one
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <Text size="3" css={{ lineHeight: '23px' }}>
        The other main improvement is with tables, which we'll probably use a lot. With
        horizontal overflow on small devices and when zoomed in, tables are a pain to
        navigate. I added a focus wrapper that will announce the table context to the
        user when focused, which also allows keyboard users to navigate the overflow
        more easily.
      </Text>
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="accordion-two">
    <AccordionTrigger>
     Accordion two
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      <Text size="3" css={{ lineHeight: '23px' }}>
